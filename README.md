# 🧠 Meme Syndicate Protocol

## 🪙 Overview

The **Meme Syndicate Protocol** is an advanced intelligence and deployment system for identifying, analyzing, and monetizing high-potential memes through cryptocurrency creation. By integrating narrative intelligence, community analysis, and temporal pattern recognition, the system identifies memetic potential **before conventional metrics detect it**.
